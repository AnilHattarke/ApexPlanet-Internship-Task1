This project is developed as part of my Web Development Internship Task at ApexPlanet Software Pvt Ltd.
The objective of this task is to understand and implement core front-end web technologies by creating a simple yet interactive webpage.

The project demonstrates the use of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity, following beginner-friendly and industry-relevant practices.
